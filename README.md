 Final project code folder

Dear reader,

Thank you for opening and going through our project in this Github folder. 
The main goal of this project is to predict the arrival delay of busses for SL in Stockholm.
In the Python code in this directory, this task is fulfilled with several different machine learning models:
- Ordinary Least Square linear regression
- Ridge linear regression
- Decision trees
- Random forest
- XGBoost
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural network

We compare the results obtained with these models both with and without cosnidering realtime data.

This directory contains the following files:
- The Python code for the project: "AH2179 final project group 4.ipynb"
- The trained final model: "weights.best.h5"

We hope that you enjoy the content in the directory.

Yours sincerely,

group 4 of the course AH2179 Applied artifical intelligence in transportation (2023/2024)
